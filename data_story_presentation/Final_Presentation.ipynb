    "   A few short months into the start of 2020, our world was just beginning to feel the effects of the COVID-19 virus. As the virus ravaged across the globe, countries all over the world imposed restrictive “lockdowns” creating an undeniably pivotal moment in world history. With over 72.1 million cases and 1.61 million deaths worldwide and counting, the globe has been in mourning, and for the most part, stuck inside houses as we have had to adjust to a new normal.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   Countries have imposed restrictions including stay at home orders, some as strict as to not let their citizens leave the house unless absolutley necessary. What many now know as the new normal including terms such as “social distancing,” “working from home,” “self-isolation,” and “masks required” were extremely novel in the winter months of the year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   With millions of people confined to their houses, the use of technological devices and social media are what many turned to during these tumultuous times. Using technology to keep up with the breaking news, to attend Zoom meetings, and to search for answers increased everyone's screen time by a lot, many times involving searching for COVID-19 symptoms and testing sites. However, with isolation and deterring from daily routines, maintaining one's mental health became a struggle for many people after constant alerts of bleak news and rising death tolls. \n",

    "   In America, the states that were hit the hardest by the COVID 19 virus experienced a drastic increase in cases and deaths beginning in late March. These states experienced booms in case and death counts, with no signs of the spread slowing. Eventually the virus reached every part of the country and 'lockdowns' began aiding slowing the spread. However, the summer months proved to bring another spike in cases and deaths and the numbers began to rise. The top six states with the highest mean death and case counts over the course of 2020 are presented here: \n",

    "__This data was collected and analyzed from open COVID-19 data on github ranging from the months of January 2020 to October 2020. After finding the states with the highest mean case and death count, their increase in counts are plotted over time. States including California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Texas had the highest case and death tolls over the months of January to October 2020.__\n",

    "## Mental Health Symptom Search \n",
    "\n",
    "   The months of March and April signaled the beginning of the pandemic, with no end in sight. The cases and death count in the United States were rising quickly and the bleak news translated into affecting not only people's physical health, but their mental health as well. As case and death count rose, Google Trends data  was collected on all symptoms that Americans were searching for including their mental and physical health. After narrowing down the mental health search symtoms, the cumulative searches showed a stronger correlation between COVID-19 case and death peaks and increased searches for mental health symptoms such as 'anxiety' and 'depression' during the early months of the pandemic. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   These heat maps that were created by analyzing data from Google Trends to show the correlation between case and death rates in states and the searches for the symptom 'anxiety.' The deeper red colored squares on the heat map represents a stronger correlation, the deeper blue colored squares, the less strong of a correlation. The heat maps focus on one month and rank the states from greatest to least strongest correlation. The heat map for these correlations is shown here: \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### __New cases and new deaths of COVID-19 and how they correlate to mental health symptom 'anxiety' Google search__\n",
    "* In the month of March, states that had the highest mean case and death counts are colored red which means that there is a stronger correlation to searching for mental the health symptom of 'anxiety.' \n",

    "#### __New deaths per month of COVID-19 and how it correlates to mental health symptom 'depression' Google search__\n",
    "* In April, states that had the highest correlation between mean death counts and the mental health Google Trend search for 'depression' are more red and listed at the top of the heat map. These red colored states on the heat map suggest that there were more of an effect on the mental health of the residents of the states that had high death tolls.\n",

    "Although there was not as strong of a correlation between the symptom search 'depression' and new cases of COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic, the search for 'depression' also gained popularity when new cases of COVID-19 began increasing in the early summer months of May and June:\n",
    "* In June, the search for 'depression' was still popular, despite it being the start of the summer. This heat map suggests that these mental health symptom searches expanded past the winter, a time when seasonal depression is common. This heat map suggests that the searches for mental health related symptoms were not due solely to seasonal depression but rather the ongoing pandemic.\n",

    "    Heat maps by Parker Jones\n",
    "\n",
    "  These heat maps support the hypothesis that during the months when cases and deaths were spiking, people were searching for mental health symptoms as well. This effect on the mental health of American citizens can be hypothesized to be due in part to depressing news, isolation in homes, and state of the world due to COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Health Symptom Search\n",
    "   As the year moved into the earlier summer months of May and June, there was yet another spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths. As shown before, the mental health of Americans was being affected, even during the summer. The symptom search for 'depression' was still popular in early summer months, but the increase in COVID-19 related symptoms such as 'cough' and 'fever' were gaining popularity. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The early summer months of the year showed correlation between increases in search queries for these physical health symptoms and COVID-19 increases in case and death counts across the country. The heat map for these correlations is shown here: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### __New cases and new deaths from COVID-19 and how they correlate to COVID symptom 'cough' Google search__\n",
    "* In the early months of the pandemic, the search queries for COVID-19 related symptoms were not as popular. When the second wave of the virus hit the U.S., the physical symptom search became very popular as citizens gained more knowledge of the COVID-19 related symptoms. \n",

    "![](graphs/newdeaths_fever.png)\n",
    "    Heat maps by Parker Jones\n",
    "\n",
    "   These heat maps show that the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths had an effect on the search queries for COVID-19 symptoms. This increase in COVID-19 symptom searches can be hypothesized to be attributed to the more knowledge that people around the United States gained of the virus, its devastating tolls, and what symptoms to be on the look out for if they began to feel ill. \n",
    "   \n",
    "## Take aways\n",
    "   It becomes apparent that during the earlier months of the pandemic, citizens of the U.S. were heavily searching for mental health related symptoms such as 'anxiety' and 'depression' which could be due in part to witnessing friends and loved ones being effected by the virus as well as the depressing news surrounding the ever increasing rise in numbers of the COVID-19 cases and deaths. The increase in mental health search queries in the winter could potentially be related to seasonal depression but it is more likely that the searches for mental health symptoms were related to the constant devastating COVID-19 news, which can be supported by the finding that 'depression' was still a popular search even in the early summer months when cases and deaths were rising exponentially. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Overall, there were many events occurring in the year of 2020 including Black Lives Matter protests in June and July, a national pandemic, and a presidential election in November. All of these could have had an effect on the mental and physical health of American citizens, but it is likely that the pandemic exacerbated these effects. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   These Google Trend search queries provide a snapshot into the year that will forever be defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the relationship between how citizens are feeling both physically and mentally and the rise in cases and deaths caused by the virus. Although in the earlier months of the lockdowns it appears as though people were more often searching for mental health symptoms, when the second wave of the pandemic hit in May and June, people began searching for more physical health related symptoms. Overall, people were struggling both with their mental and physical health, but the increases in cases and deaths over time provides an interesting timeline of how people were feeling as the year progressed."
