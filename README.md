## My final project question for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

* My main quesiton is to see if there is a relationship between the months of high case and death rates of COVID 19 in the United States from January 2020- October 2020 and if there is a relationship to peaks in Google Trends searches for COVID-19 symptoms and mental health symptoms such as 'anxiety' and 'depression'?
